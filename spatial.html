            <h2>Space Exploration</h2>
            <p>History  of Exploration: First telescopes
            The first telescope is said to have been invented in 1608 in the Netherlands by an eyeglass maker named Hans Lippershey, but their first recorded use in astronomy was 
            by Galileo Galilei in 1609.[8] In 1668 Isaac Newton built his own reflecting telescope, the first fully functional telescope of this kind, and a landmark for future 
            developments due to its superior features over the previous Galilean telescope. A string of discoveries in the Solar System (and beyond) followed, then and in the next 
            centuries: the mountains of the Moon, the phases of Venus, the main satellites of Jupiter and Saturn, the rings of Saturn, many comets, the asteroids, the new planets Uranus 
            and Neptune, and many more satellites. The Orbiting Astronomical Observatory 2 was the first space telescope launched 1968,[10] but the launching of Hubble Space Telescope 
            in 1990[11] set a milestone. As of 1 December 2022, there were 5,284 confirmed exoplanets discovered. The Milky Way is estimated to contain 100–400 billion stars[12] and more 
            than 100 billion planets.[13] There are at least 2 trillion galaxies in the observable universe. HD1 is the most distant known object from Earth, reported as 33.4 billion 
            light-years away.
<br><br>
            First outer space flights: MW 18014 was a German V-2 rocket test launch that took place on 20 June 1944, at the Peenemünde Army Research Center in Peenemünde. It was the  
            first human-made object to reach outer space, attaining an apogee of 176 kilometers,[22] which is well above the Kármán line.[23] It was a vertical test launch. Although 
            the rocket reached space, it did not reach orbital velocity, and therefore returned to Earth in an impact, becoming the first sub-orbital spaceflight.
<br><br>
            First object in orbit: The first successful orbital launch was of the Soviet uncrewed Sputnik 1 ("Satellite 1") mission on 4 October 1957. The satellite weighed about 83 kg 
            (183 lb), and is believed to have orbited Earth at a height of about 250 km (160 mi). It had two radio transmitters (20 and 40 MHz), which emitted "beeps" that could be heard 
            by radios around the globe. Analysis of the radio signals was used to gather information about the electron density of the ionosphere, while temperature and pressure data was
            encoded in the duration of radio beeps. The results indicated that the satellite was not punctured by a meteoroid. Sputnik 1 was launched by an R-7 rocket. It burned up upon 
            re-entry on 3 January 1958.
<br><br>
            First human outer space flight: The first successful human spaceflight was Vostok 1 ("East 1"), carrying the 27-year-old Russian cosmonaut, Yuri Gagarin, on 12 April 1961. 
            The spacecraft completed one orbit around the globe, lasting about 1 hour and 48 minutes. Gagarin's flight resonated around the world; it was a demonstration of the advanced 
            Soviet space program and it opened an entirely new era in space exploration: human spaceflight.
<br><br>
            First astronomical body space explorations: The first artificial object to reach another celestial body was Luna 2 reaching the Moon in 1959. The first soft landing on 
            another celestial body was performed by Luna 9 landing on the Moon on 3 February 1966. Luna 10 became the first artificial satellite of the Moon, entering in a lunar orbit
             on 3 April 1966.  
<br><br>          
            The first crewed landing on another celestial body was performed by Apollo 11 on 20 July 1969, landing on the Moon. There have been a total of six spacecraft with humans 
            landing on the Moon starting from 1969 to the last human landing in 1972. The first interplanetary flyby was the 1961 Venera 1 flyby of Venus, though the 1962 Mariner 2 was 
            the first flyby of Venus to return data (closest approach 34,773 kilometers). Pioneer 6 was the first satellite to orbit the Sun, launched on 16 December 1965. The other planets
            were first flown by in 1965 for Mars by Mariner 4, 1973 for Jupiter by Pioneer 10, 1974 for Mercury by Mariner 10, 1979 for Saturn by Pioneer 11, 1986 for Uranus by Voyager 2, 
            1989 for Neptune by Voyager 2. In 2015, the dwarf planets Ceres and Pluto were orbited by Dawn and passed by New Horizons, respectively. This accounts for flybys of each of the 
            eight planets in the Solar System, the Sun, the Moon, and Ceres and Pluto (two of the five recognized dwarf planets).                
            The first interplanetary surface mission to return at least limited surface data from another planet was the 1970 landing of Venera 7, which returned data to Earth for 23 minutes
            from Venus. In 1975 the Venera 9 was the first to return images from the surface of another planet, returning images from Venus. In 1971 the Mars 3 mission achieved the first
            soft landing on Mars returning data for almost 20 seconds. Later much longer duration surface missions were achieved, including over six years of Mars surface operation by Viking 1
            from 1975 to 1982 and over two hours of transmission from the surface of Venus by Venera 13 in 1982, the longest ever Soviet planetary surface mission. Venus and Mars are the two 
            planets outside of Earth on which humans have conducted surface missions with uncrewed robotic spacecraft.
<br><br> 
            First space station: Salyut 1 was the first space station of any kind, launched into low Earth orbit by the Soviet Union on 19 April 1971. The International Space Station is 
            currently the largest and oldest of the 2 current fully functional space stations, inhabited continuously since the year 2000. The other, Tiangong space station built by China,
            is now fully crewed and operational.                
 <br><br>
            First interstellar space flight: Voyager 1 became the first human-made object to leave the Solar System into interstellar space on 25 August 2012. The probe passed the heliopause
             at 121 AU to enter interstellar space.
<br><br>
            Farthest from Earth: The Apollo 13 flight passed the far side of the Moon at an altitude of 254 kilometers (158 miles; 137 nautical miles) above the lunar surface, and 400,171 km 
            (248,655 mi) from Earth, marking the record for the farthest humans have ever traveled from Earth in 1970. As of 26 November 2022 Voyager 1 was at a distance of 159 AU 
            (23.8 billion km; 14.8 billion mi) from Earth. It is the most distant human-made object from Earth.
<br><br>
            Space exploration is the ongoing discovery and exploration of celestial structures in outer space by means of continuously evolving and growing space technology.
            Space exploration is the use of astronomy and space technology to explore outer space. While the exploration of space is currently carried out mainly by 
            astronomers with telescopes, its physical exploration is conducted both by uncrewed robotic space probes and human spaceflight. Space exploration, like its classical 
            form astronomy, is one of the main sources for space science.While the observation of objects in space, known as astronomy, predates reliable recorded history, it was
            the development of large and relatively efficient rockets during the mid-twentieth century that allowed physical space exploration to become a reality. Common rationales 
            for exploring space include advancing scientific research, national prestige, uniting different nations, ensuring the future survival of humanity, and developing military 
            and strategic advantages against other countries. The early era of space exploration was driven by a "Space Race" between the Soviet Union and the United States. A driving
            force of the start of space exploration was during the Cold War. After the ability to create nuclear weapons, the narrative of defense/offense left land and the power to 
            control the air became the focus. Both the Soviet and the U.S. were fighting to prove their superiority in technology through exploring the unknown: space. In fact, the 
            reason NASA was made was due to the response of Sputnik I.[3] The launch of the first human-made object to orbit Earth, the Soviet Union's Sputnik 1, on 4 October 1957, 
            and the first Moon landing by the American Apollo 11 mission on 20 July 1969 are often taken as landmarks for this initial period. The Soviet space program achieved many 
            of the first milestones, including the first living being in orbit in 1957, the first human spaceflight (Yuri Gagarin aboard Vostok 1) in 1961, the first spacewalk 
            (by Alexei Leonov) on 18 March 1965, the first automatic landing on another celestial body in 1966, and the launch of the first space station (Salyut 1) in 1971.

            <h2>Interesting information about ISS</h2>
            <p>History:As the space race drew to a close in the early 1970s, the US and USSR began to contemplate a variety of potential collaborations in outer space. 
            This culminated in the 1975 Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, the first docking of spacecraft from two different spacefaring nations. The ASTP was considered a 
            success, and further joint missions were also contemplated. One such concept was International Skylab, which proposed launching the backup Skylab B space 
            station for a mission that would see multiple visits by both Apollo and Soyuz crew vehicles.
            More ambitious was the Skylab-Salyut Space Laboratory, which proposed docking the Skylab B to a Soviet Salyut space station. Falling budgets and rising cold war 
            tensions in the late 1970s saw these concepts fall by the wayside, along with another plan to have the Space Shuttle dock with a Salyut space station. 
<br><br>
            In the early 1980s, NASA planned to launch a modular
            space station called Freedom as a counterpart to the Salyut and Mir space stations. In 1984 the ESA was invited to participate in Space Station Freedom, and 
            the ESA approved the Columbus laboratory by 1987. The Japanese Experiment Module (JEM), or Kibō, was announced in 1985, as part of the Freedom space station 
            in response to a NASA request in 1982. In early 1985, science ministers from the European Space Agency (ESA) countries approved the Columbus programme, the most 
            ambitious effort in space undertaken by that organization at the time. The plan spearheaded by Germany and Italy included a module which would be attached to Freedom,
            and with the capability to evolve into a full-fledged European orbital outpost before the end of the century. Increasing costs threw these plans into doubt in 
            the early 1990s. Congress was unwilling to provide enough money to build and operate Freedom, and demanded NASA increase international participation to defray 
            the rising costs or they would cancel the entire project outright. 
<br><br>            
            Simultaneously, the USSR was conducting planning for the Mir-2 space station, and had begun 
            constructing modules for the new station by the mid 1980s. However the collapse of the Soviet Union required these plans to be greatly downscaled, and soon Mir-2
            was in danger of never being launched at all. With both space station projects in jeopardy, American and Russian officials met and proposed they be combined.                 
            In September 1993, American Vice-President Al Gore and Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin announced plans for a new space station, which eventually became
            the International Space Station. They also agreed, in preparation for this new project, that the United States would be involved in the Mir programme, including
            American Shuttles docking, in the Shuttle–Mir programme. 
<br><br>
            On 12 April 2021, at a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, then-Deputy Prime Minister Yury Borisov
            announced he had decided that Russia might withdraw from the ISS programme in 2025. According to Russian authorities, the timeframe of the station's operations
            has expired and its condition leaves much to be desired. On 26 July 2022, Borisov, who had become head of Roscosmos, submitted to Putin his plans for withdrawal 
            from the programme after 2024.[27] However, Robyn Gatens, the NASA official in charge of space station operations, responded that NASA had not received any formal 
            notices from Roscosmos concerning withdrawal plans.[28] On 21 September 2022, Borisov stated that Russia was "highly likely" to continue to participate in the ISS 
            programme until 2028. The International Space Station (ISS) is a large space station assembled and maintained in low Earth orbit by a collaboration of five space 
            agencies and their contractors: NASA (United States), Roscosmos (Russia), JAXA (Japan), ESA (Europe), and CSA (Canada). 
<br><br>
            The ISS is the largest space station ever built.
            Its primary purpose is to perform microgravity and space environment experiments. Operationally, the station is divided into two sections: the Russian Orbital Segment (ROS) 
             assembled by Roscosmos, and the US Orbital Segment, assembled by NASA, JAXA, ESA and CSA. A striking feature of the ISS is the Integrated Truss Structure, which 
            connects the large solar panels and radiators to the pressurized modules. The pressurized modules are specialized for research, habitation, storage, spacecraft control,
            and airlock functions. Visiting spacecraft dock at the station via its eight docking and berthing ports. The ISS maintains an orbit with an average altitude of 400 kilometres
            (250 mi)and circles the Earth in roughly 93 minutes, completing 15.5 orbits per day. The ISS programme combines two prior plans to construct crewed Earth-orbiting stations:
            Space Station Freedom planned by the United States, and the Mir-2 station, planned by the Soviet Union. The first ISS module was launched in 1998. Major modules have been 
            launched by Proton and Soyuz rockets and by the Space Shuttle launch system. The first long-term residents, Expedition 1, arrived on November 2, 2000. Since then, the station 
            has been continuously occupied for 23 years and 220 days, the longest continuous human presence in space. As of March 2024, 279 individuals from 22 countries have visited the
            space station.[15] The ISS is expected to have additional modules (the Axiom Orbital Segment, for example) before being de-orbited by a dedicated NASA spacecraft in January 2031.
            The International Space Station (ISS) travels at a speed of 28,000 kilometers per hour (17,500 miles per hour)?</p>
